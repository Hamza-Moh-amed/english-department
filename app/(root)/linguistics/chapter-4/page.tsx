              Standardization refers to the process of designing, administering,
              and scoring tests in a consistent and objective manner to ensure
              fairness and comparability of results. It involves establishing
              uniform procedures for all aspects of testing, reducing the
              potential for variations that could impact test scores. This
              consistency allows for meaningful comparisons of scores across
              different test administrations and populations.

              <li>
                Define the purpose and objectives: Clearly articulate the
                purpose of the test and the specific skills and knowledge it
                aims to measure. For instance, is the test intended to assess
                general language proficiency or specific language skills related
                to a particular field or occupation?
              </li>
              <li>
                Design test specifications: Create a detailed plan outlining the
                content, format, and structure of the test. This blueprint
                guides the development of test items and ensures that the test
                aligns with the defined objectives.
              </li>
              <li>
                Develop and select test tasks/items: Carefully craft test items
                that effectively measure the targeted skills and knowledge.
                Items should be clear, unambiguous, and representative of the
                test content outlined in the specifications.
              </li>
              <li>
                Evaluate item quality: Use statistical analyses and expert
                review to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of test items.
                Items that are too easy, too difficult, or do not discriminate
                effectively between test-takers at different proficiency levels
                should be revised or discarded.
              </li>
              <li>
                Establish scoring procedures and reporting formats: Determine
                how test scores will be calculated, interpreted, and reported.
                This step involves establishing scoring rubrics, determining cut
                scores for proficiency levels, and designing user-friendly score
                reports.
              </li>
              <li>
                Conduct ongoing validation studies: Continuously monitor the
                test's validity by gathering evidence to support its intended
                interpretations and uses. This ongoing process helps ensure that
                the test remains a reliable and valid measure of the targeted
                constructs.

                    Standardization is the process of designing, administering,
                    and scoring tests in a consistent and objective manner. This
                    uniformity ensures fairness, minimizes variations that might
                    impact scores, and enables meaningful comparisons across
                    different administrations and populations.

                    How can excessive focus on test-driven learning undermine
                    genuine language acquisition?
                  </strong>
                  <p>
                    When too much emphasis is placed on preparing for
                    standardized tests, students may focus narrowly on
                    test-taking strategies rather than developing authentic
                    communicative skills. This can lead to a form of learning
                    that prioritizes short-term memorization over long-term
                    language competence, raising ethical concerns about the
                    overall educational process.
