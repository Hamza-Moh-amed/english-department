              The term “ethnicity” gained widespread currency in the mid- to
              late twentieth century, naming a process by which individuals or
              groups came to be understood, or to understand themselves, as
              separate or different from others. This meaning of “ethnicity”
              commonly referred to the consciousness of exclusion or
              subordination, though it also indexed social practices—language,
              religion, rituals, and other patterns of behavior—that define the
              content of a group’s culture.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              The spread of this theory of ethnic culture created two mutually
              exclusive, analytically separate categories: “ethnicity,” defined
              as cultural traits, was utterly divorced from the workings of the
              physical body, defined as “race.” When anthropologists such as
              Franz Boas (1940) of Columbia University and sociologists and
              anthropologists from the University of Chicago began to teach
              students in the early twentieth century that cultural
              characteristics were the most interesting social phenomena for
              study, they spread at the same time the idea that any attention to
              physical characteristics was intellectually inappropriate.
              Attacking justifications for racial hierarchy grounded in biology,
              social scientists used the concept of ethnicity as a weapon
              against racial thinking. “Ethnicity” thus became the term that
              named an alternative to the earlier biological emphases of racial
              hierarchy. In *Man’s Most Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race*
              (1942), one of the most significant antiracist books published in
              the twentieth century, the anthropologist Ashley Montagu argued
              that race as a category of analysis should be dropped as a
              dangerous invention and that “ethnic group” was a more neutral
              term. “Ethnicity” became synonymous with cultural difference, and
              any theory dependent on physical characteristics was dismissed as
              racist. Similarly, the attempt by anthropologists such as Ruth
              Benedict (1934) to array societies in a spectrum of cultures aided
              this flattening of all human distinction into a matter of cultural
              or ethnic difference. Possibilities for the elimination of racial
              prejudice (defined specifically as the expression of conscious
              attitudes about a group of people considered racially different)
              depended on a very specific definition of race as a form of
              consciousness. Race was a myth because it had no basis in biology,
              yet race as a consciousness about the importance of a set of
              physical attributes could still exist. Because consciousness of
              race was claimed to be merely one form of ethnic consciousness,
              race and ethnicity were concepts simultaneously distinct and
              indistinct from each other. The subsuming of race under the
              broader category of ethnicity was both a significant attempt at
              offering a solution to racial conflict and a sign of the
              persistent difficulties with distinguishing between the two. As a
              matter of consciousness, the racial culture of “Negro Americans”
              was no different in kind than the ethnic culture of “Polish
              Americans,” and purely cultural processes of assimilation could
              eliminate all differences between them. However, there were
              chronic difficulties with the distinction between race and
              ethnicity. W. Lloyd Warner and Leo Srole’s widely read *Social
              Systems of American Ethnic Groups* (1945) exemplified the paradox
              inherent in this distinction. According to them, the host society
              accepted some groups more easily than others. Class differences
              tended to fragment ethnic groups, and the class mobility of some
              members of ethnic groups was the major determinant of acceptance
              within the host society. Most difficult to accept, however, were
              those groups seen to be racially different. Although Warner and
              Srole argued that group conflict was a matter of ethnic
              identification (in the sense that the host society viewed a group
              as different, and the group viewed themselves as different), they
              also assumed that there was some characteristic that set apart
              ethnic groups that were racially defined. The “future of American
              ethnic groups seems to be limited,” Warner and Srole concluded;
              “it is likely that they will be quickly absorbed. When this
              happens one of the great epochs of American history will have
              ended and another, that of race, will begin” (295). This sense
              that a great epoch of ethnicity was about to end at midcentury was
              a product of a crucial social transformation in the decades
              following the explicitly racialized immigration exclusion policies
              of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

            <p className="text-lg">
              By the 1920s, U.S. social scientists (some of whom were themselves
              either migrants or children of migrants) had created a body of
              theories of race and culture that had grown out of studying mass
              migration (Yu 2001). The most significant of these studies were
              associated with sociologists such as William I. Thomas (Thomas and
              Znanieki 1918–20) and Robert E. Park (1950) at the University of
              Chicago. Park and Thomas were at the forefront of an attempt to
              advance a new theory about social interaction based on the concept
              of culture. In opposition to earlier theories about the importance
              of inherited characteristics and physical bodies in determining
              human behavior, cultural theories emphasized the centrality of
              consciousness, of the mental attitudes and forms of
              self-understanding that people communicated through writing,
              speech, and other media. One of the most important of these
              theories concerned what Park and Thomas labeled “cultural
              assimilation,” the process by which two groups communicated with
              each other and came to share common experiences, memories, and
              histories. Applied specifically to U.S. immigrants, the theory of
              assimilation promised that any migrant, no matter how different in
              language, religion, or other social practices at the moment of
              arrival, could learn to assimilate national cultural norms. This
              historically progressive vision of the United States became the
              foundation for later arguments about ethnic consciousness,
              self-identity, and group identity. At the same time, the
              twentieth-century “alchemy of race” (Jacobson 1998) had its
              origins in the mechanisms by which European immigrants who were
              defined at the beginning of the century as racially different came
              to be seen as “white” ethnics by the end of the century (Brodkin
              1998). Along with the intellectual transformation wrought by
              cultural theory, popular writers such as Louis Adamic, who was
              himself of recent immigrant ancestry, pushed for an overcoming of
              the nativist divide between old and new U.S. Americans. In books
              such as *From Many Lands* (1940) and *Nation of Nations* (1944),
              Adamic reconceived the United States as a land of immigrants,
              subsuming what had earlier been major dividing lines such as
              religion and language into mere differences of ethnic culture. At
              the same time (and with Adamic’s assistance), organizations such
              as the National Council of Christians and Jews, founded in 1928,
              were striving to unify Protestants, Catholics, Orthodox
              Christians, and Jews into a so-called Judeo-Christian tradition.
              This period also saw widespread mass-cultural arguments for the
              end of religious discrimination, perhaps most visibly in 1950s
              Hollywood motion pictures such as *The Ten Commandments* (1956)
              and *Ben-Hur* (1959). The focus on the assimilation of religious
              differences, powerfully propelled by wartime propaganda against
              the genocidal science of Nazism, helped label anti-Semitism and
              anti-Catholicism as un-American. By the end of the 1950s, class
              mobility fueled by the postwar Montgomery GI Bill and federal
              subsidies of suburban housing had made Adamic’s dream of an
              amalgamation of new and old seem viable. The truth is that such
              programs of social engineering were predominantly focused on men
              able to pass as white. Immigrants who had been treated in the
              period between 1890 and 1920 as racially different (Slavs, Jews,
              southern Europeans such as Italians, Greeks, and Armenians) were
              now transformed into white ethnics, mere varieties of white
              people. Just as dividing lines over religion, which had seemed
              intractable a generation before, were now reduced to mere
              denominational differences, all such culturally defined elements
              of difference had disappeared into a generic whiteness marked only
              superficially by vestiges of ethnic culture.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Ironically, the civil rights movement of the 1950s helped
              reinforce this process of ethnic transformation. Jewish American
              intellectuals of the 1930s and 1940s had been at the forefront of
              political coalitions with African Americans seeking civil rights.
              Similarities in discrimination and exclusion at work and in the
              legal segregation of housing and public facilities had drawn
              Jewish and African Americans together to fight for civil rights.
              However, paralleling the larger transformation of white ethnics,
              Jewish Americans by the end of the civil rights era had become
              solidly white, even if anti-Semitism remained in vestigial and
              virulent forms. The civil rights movement for blacks ended up
              helping immigrant groups that previously had been the targets of
              racial nativism to amalgamate into a new ethnic “whiteness.”
              Despite these formidable intellectual and political problems,
              “ethnicity” has continued to be used widely as a description of
              and prescription for social life. Indeed, the acceptance and
              eventual celebration of ethnic difference was one of the most
              significant transitions of the twentieth century. Coincident with
              the increasing awareness of migration at the beginning of the
              century, a cosmopolitan appreciation of exotic difference arose.
              Writing in the days before World War I, a number of New York
              intellectuals embraced the rich diversity of the city, forecasting
              that the eclectic mix of global migrants was the future of U.S.
              society. Randolph Bourne’s vision of a “transnational America”
              (1916) and Horace Kallen’s description of “cultural pluralism”
              (1915) argued against the xenophobia that fueled the immigration
              exclusion acts of the same period, replacing it with an embrace of
              the exotic. The consumption by elite whites of the music and art
              of the Harlem Renaissance in the 1920s, along with periodic fads
              for Oriental art and so-called primitive tribal objects, reflected
              an embrace of the different as valuable.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              The celebration of exoticism in theories about the cosmopolitan
              self laid the groundwork for two major developments concerning
              ethnicity. The first was the theoretical foundation for the
              commercialization of ethnic difference; the second was the
              creation of a new definition of elite, enlightened whiteness.
              Beginning with the fascination with exotic art forms in modernism,
              but also embodied in the hunger for ethnic food and objects, a
              tasteful appreciation of the exotic became part of an educational
              program to combat racism and ignorance in the 1960s. At the same
              time that education was touted as the answer to race relations,
              ethnic music and other forms of exotic art and entertainment were
              offered at first as alternatives to the mass productions of
              popular culture and by the 1990s as important commodities
              distributed and consumed in the marketplace. Interestingly, the
              rise and spread of a cosmopolitan embrace of exotic difference
              helped expand the boundaries of whiteness. One of the ways in
              which those individuals formerly excluded as racially or
              ethnically suspect could “whiten” themselves was by embracing
              cosmopolitan ideas. Those who continued to express racist opinions
              were subsumed under the newly enlarged rubric of white racists (a
              category that “whitened” former ethnics at the same time that it
              tarred them as ignorant bigots of the lower classes). The embrace
              of cosmopolitan ideals offered a way of becoming an elite,
              enlightened white. Whether it was black music or Chinese food, an
              appreciation of exotic difference signaled one’s aspiration to a
              higher class status. These ideas were spread through advertising
              and by an education system that began in the 1940s to promote this
              outlook on ethnicity and class. By the end of the twentieth
              century, objects associated with ethnicity enjoyed a popular boom
              as commercial goods. Ethnic objects that had assumed the status of
              collectible art (such as African tribal masks and Native American
              totem poles), items of everyday use (such as Chinese woks and
              chopsticks or Scottish tartan kilts), performances of identity
              that could be consumed (ethnic music and dance): all were packaged
              as desirable objects of consumption. Ethnicity was something to be
              collected by a tasteful consumer able to appreciate an array of
              objects. This commercialization of ethnicity also allowed those
              who were identified as different to turn that identification into
              an object with value. Musical styles such as rhythm and blues,
              rock and roll, soul, rap, and hip-hop were marketed through an
              association with their black origins. By the 1970s, the
              commercialization of ethnicity extended to those ethnics who had
              been targets of xenophobia but were now comfortably white. White
              ethnics could continue to express cosmopolitan appreciation for
              the exoticism of nonwhites, but they could also embrace signs of
              their own ethnicity without fear of exclusion from the privileges
              of whiteness. White ethnicity was thus securely different from
              nonwhite racial ethnicity, and white ethnics drew on a history as
              victims of discrimination in ways that attenuated their own
              enjoyment of the privileges of being white, even as it evoked
              parallels to the historical suffering of nonwhites.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              There are many long-term legacies of this history of ethnicity,
              including the rise of “whiteness studies” and the current use of
              the term “ethnicity” in the U.S. media to describe a wide array of
              subnational and transnational conflicts. The ethnic cultural
              theory that underwrites these legacies derived its popular appeal
              from the combination of two elements. One was the description of
              how European immigrants were transformed into white ethnics during
              the mid-twentieth century; the other was the hope that this social
              process would also work for U.S. Americans subordinated as
              nonwhite. However, the extension of what Nathan Glazer (1983, 92)
              called the “ethnic analogy” to the problems of racial hierarchy
              has often foundered because of a widespread belief that ethnicity
              is a matter of choice. This mistake is a direct result of the way
              the concept was modeled on the extension of the privileges of
              white supremacy to those who could voluntarily erase signs of
              their foreign origins and the withholding of those privileges from
              those who could not. The process of forgetting the historical
              origins of ethnicity in white supremacy continues today in
              arguments about its definition.

              Henry Yu’s article on *Ethnicity* explores how the term gained
              widespread currency in the mid- to late twentieth century as a way
              to describe the cultural practices and consciousness of groups
              that were seen as separate or different from others. Yu argues
              that ethnicity became a tool for social scientists to combat
              racial thinking by emphasizing cultural traits over physical
              characteristics. This shift was part of a broader intellectual
              movement led by anthropologists like Franz Boas and sociologists
              from the University of Chicago, who sought to dismantle racial
              hierarchies grounded in biology.

              This redefinition of ethnicity as a cultural construct marked a

              However, Yu also highlights the paradox inherent in this
              distinction, as ethnicity and race remained simultaneously
              distinct and indistinct from each other. This tension underscores
              the complexity of using ethnicity as a framework for understanding

            <p className="text-lg">
              Yu emphasizes the pivotal role of social scientists in shaping the
              concept of ethnicity. Figures like Franz Boas, Ashley Montagu, and
              Ruth Benedict were instrumental in promoting the idea that
              cultural characteristics, rather than physical traits, were the
              most important social phenomena to study. Montagu’s *Man’s Most
              Dangerous Myth: The Fallacy of Race* (1942) was particularly
              influential in arguing that race was a dangerous invention and
              that “ethnic group” was a more neutral and accurate term.

              This intellectual shift had profound implications for how
              ethnicity was understood and studied. By framing ethnicity as a
              cultural phenomenon, social scientists sought to challenge racial
              prejudice and promote a more inclusive understanding of human
              difference. However, Yu also critiques this approach for its
              failure to fully address the persistent difficulties in
              distinguishing between race and ethnicity.

              Yu examines how the concept of ethnicity was closely tied to the

              work of sociologists like William I. Thomas and Robert E. Park,
              who developed theories of cultural assimilation to explain how
              immigrants could learn to adopt national cultural norms. This
              process was particularly significant for European immigrants, who
              were initially seen as racially different but eventually became
              “white ethnics” by the mid-twentieth century.

              This transformation was facilitated by social programs like the

              Yu discusses how ethnicity became a commodity in the late

                  analysis?
                </strong>
                <p>
                  The “alchemy of race” refers to the transformation of European
                  immigrants from racially different to “white ethnics” by the
                  mid-twentieth century. This process, facilitated by social
                  programs and intellectual shifts, reinforced the boundaries of
                  whiteness and allowed certain immigrant groups to shed their
                  racialized identities.

                  How does Yu’s work contribute to the field of ethnic studies?
                </strong>
                <p>
                  Yu’s work contributes to the field of ethnic studies by
                  critically examining the concept of ethnicity and its
                  limitations. He highlights the need for a more nuanced
                  understanding of ethnicity that takes into account its
                  historical and political dimensions, challenging readers to
                  rethink how they understand and engage with social difference.

                  What is the broader implication of Yu’s argument for
                  understanding ethnicity in contemporary society?
                </strong>
                <p>
                  The broader implication of Yu’s argument is that ethnicity
                  must be understood as a dynamic and multifaceted concept that
                  is deeply tied to the moral, political, and economic
                  structures of modernity. He calls for a critical interrogation
                  of ethnicity that addresses its intersections with race,
                  gender, and class, as well as its role in shaping both freedom
                  and subjection.
