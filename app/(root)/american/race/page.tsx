                The study of race incorporates a set of wide-ranging analyses of
                freedom and power. The scope of those analyses has much to do
                with the broad application of racial difference to academic and
                popular notions of epistemology, community, identity, and the
                body. With regard to economic and political formations, race has
                shaped the meaning and profile of citizenship and labor. In
                relation to corporeality, race has rendered the body into a text
                on which histories of racial differentiation, exclusion, and
                violence are inscribed. Analyzed in terms of subjectivity, race
                helps locate the ways in which identities are constituted.

                Many of these insights are the intellectual effects of
                antiracist political struggles, particularly ones organized
                around national liberation and civil rights. In the United
                States, the minority movements of the 1950s and 1960s
                fundamentally changed the ways in which racial minorities
                thought about their identities and cultures and the ways that
                race worked within US society (Omi and Winant [1986] 1994). In
                doing so, these movements intersected with sociological
                arguments that displaced notions of race as a strict biological
                inheritance and forced scholars to confront it as a category
                with broad political and economic implications. For the first
                time, there was mass mobilization around the deployment of the
                linguistic, historical, and artistic elements of minority
                cultures as a means of challenging racial oppression within the
                United States. Black, Chicano, and Asian American political and
                cultural groups emerged out of this context.
              </p>
              <p className="article-paragraph">
                In addition to cultural recovery, these groups argued for land
                redistribution, the end of police brutality, and community
                control over economic development. Race emerged out of these
                movements as an expression of cultural and political agency by
                marginalized groups. This was the notion of race that underwrote
                the ethnic studies movements of the 1960s and 1970s, including
                the student protests of 1968–69 that inaugurated the Division of
                Ethnic Studies at San Francisco State University. There and
                elsewhere, departments of Asian, Chicano, Native, and black
                studies worked to challenge race as a mode of exploitation
                within US society in particular and Western nations more
                generally (Marable 2000).

                At the same time, insights about the various meanings of “race”
                have also arisen out of movements that countered these largely
                nation-based forms of racial politics. As postcolonial and
                poststructuralist theorists have illustrated, race is more than
                a way of identifying and organizing political coalitions against
                forms of state repression and capitalist exploitation; it is
                also a category that sets the terms of belonging and exclusion
                within modern institutions. David Theo Goldberg (1993, 87)
                captures this tension nicely: “[Race] has established who can be
                imported and who exported, who are immigrants and who are
                indigenous, who may be property and who are citizens; and among
                the latter who get to vote and who do not, who are protected by
                the law and who are its objects, who are employable and who are
                not, who have access and privilege and who are (to be)
                marginalized.” In other words, race both accounts for the logics
                by which institutions differentiate and classify, include and
                exclude, and names the processes by which people internalize
                those logics.

                Feminist and queer critiques of racial ideologies and discourses
                have complicated the matter further. As women of color and third
                world feminists have argued since the mid-to late 1970s, civil
                rights and national liberation struggles shared important and
                largely unappreciated affiliations with the very racist regimes
                to which they were responding, affiliations concerning mutual
                investments in heterosexual and patriarchal forms of power (C.
                Clarke 1983; Combahee River Collective 1983; A. Davis 1997;
                Ferguson 2004). One way of extending the interpretations by
                women of color and third world feminists of the gendered and
                sexualized infrastructure of racial discourse is to attend to
                the ways in which that infrastructure was produced within a
                genealogy of morality. Morality, in this context, has a much
                broader definition and application than its more restricted
                modern understanding, which sees it largely in terms of gender
                and sexual restrictions.
              </p>
              <p className="article-paragraph">
                In classical social theory, morality refers to the social powers
                and privileges that come with political and civil
                enfranchisement, thus referencing a horizon of possibility
                rather than an ambit of restrictions and limitations. It was
                precisely this quality of morality—its promise of enlargement
                and endowment—that made conservative and liberatory demands for
                freedom into vehicles for all types of regulations. Morality was
                both the promise of freedom and the qualification of that
                promise through regulation. When women of color and third world
                feminists troubled the gender and sexual footings of antiracist
                social movements, they were actually struggling against the
                moral inheritance of those movements—not simply the gender and
                sexual norms of those movements but also the imperative to
                stipulate freedom through regulation. Thinking about race within
                that genealogy allows us to see how a critical interrogation of
                race must address the gender and sexual itineraries of both
                conservative and liberatory politics. It permits us to further
                tease out the unexpected affiliations that revolutionary and
                nationalist definitions of race share with liberal-democratic
                and colonial deployments of race.
              </p>
              <p className="article-paragraph">
                Several theorists have followed these leads by locating the
                procedures of racialization within the moral discourse of
                Western modernity. By doing so, they have interpreted modernity
                as an epistemological procedure that produces racial knowledge,
                a material formation that engenders the racial foundations of
                political economy, and a discursive formation that fosters
                racial subjects. Goldberg (1993, 14), for instance, situates our
                understanding of racial modernity within moral notions that
                constitute “personal and social identity.” Take as an example
                Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s linkage of race and morality in The
                Social Contract. According to Rousseau, man’s transition from
                the state of nature to civil society effects a moral change in
                “him,” one that delivers man to the morally constituted domain
                of civil society. In the state of nature, man is “governed by
                appetite alone”; in civil society, he is ruled by justice rather
                than instinct and through this subjection ascends to freedom and
                rationality. Man thus becomes a moral being who is part of a
                civil order that gives his “actions the moral quality they
                previously lacked” ([1762] 1968, 64–65). Rousseau’s formulation
                of morality as an entrance into freedoms that are both social
                and personal can help us see the ways in which morality
                expresses a racialized genealogy that links emancipation and
                subjection.
              </p>
              <p className="article-paragraph">
                Through the history of racial formations, we can outline these
                connections between emancipation and subjection. Indeed, that
                history reveals how a commitment to political ideals of freedom
                and liberty was often understood in explicitly racial terms and
                how it required forms of gender and sexual governance. In the
                Caribbean plantation economy, for instance, slaveholders and
                colonizers stood as symbols not only of whiteness and freedom
                but also of gender and sexual morality. The bodies of nonwhite
                Caribbean subjects—blacks, “coloureds,” and indentured
                Indians—were unevenly constructed as outside the parameters of
                gender and sexual propriety (M. Jacqui Alexander 1994). In the
                nineteenth-century United States, black women’s bodies were
                similarly constructed as the antithesis of true womanhood, a
                womanhood presumably embodied by white femininity. Responding to
                this construction became a simultaneously moral and political
                agenda for black feminists during and beyond this period. As
                historian Darlene Clark Hine (1989) has argued, African American
                clubwomen subscribed in the late nineteenth century to Victorian
                ideologies of gender and sexual propriety as a means of
                subverting negative stereotypes about black women’s sexuality.
                In doing so, these clubwomen entered civil society by invoking
                forms of mastery and discipline, underlining and extending the
                connection between their relative freedom and the subjection of
                others.
              </p>
              <p className="article-paragraph">
                In the early twentieth century, this racialized genealogy shaped
                the emergence of sociology as a discipline that tried to
                assimilate US residents and citizens to the presumably rational
                ideals of liberal democracy. That discipline worked to reconcile
                communities of color, particularly African Americans, to the
                gender and sexual regimes of morality in part by pressuring them
                into normative US citizenship. For instance, W. E. B. Du Bois
                ([1900] 1978) argued for a partnership between the census (to
                track the social problems afflicting African American
                communities) and an emerging sociological profession (to lift
                African Americans from the moral residues of those problems). US
                sociology in the early to mid-twentieth century matured into a
                discipline that responded to the social changes of
                industrialization and migration by extending these moral
                prescriptions, including Gunnar Myrdal’s famous recommendation
                that African Americans adhere to the gender and sexual ideals of
                heterosexual patriarchy as a means of achieving citizenship—a
                recommendation that used the “instability of the Negro family”
                to argue that Negro culture is a “distorted development, or a
                pathological condition, of the general American culture” (1944,
                928; see also Ferguson 2005). By advocating the rational ideals
                of liberal democracy, sociology linked the political to the
                social morality of citizenship. In other words, a commitment to
                the political ideals of citizenship entailed a fidelity to the
                nuclear family, conjugal marriage, and heterosexual monogamy.
                Given this genealogy, a critical interrogation of race needs to
                locate the links between citizenship and gender and sexual
                regulation. By studying race through its emergence within this
                genealogy, we obtain an understanding of political agency as the
                extension of power and discover how political freedom is tied to
                gender and sexual subjection.
              </p>
              <p className="article-paragraph">
                Apprehending political agency through its connections to gender
                and sexual subjection is also a way of understanding the
                antiracist movements that decried regimes of race. Anticolonial
                and antiracist movements represented powerful challenges to
                racial regimes of colonial and liberal capitalist states. But
                they often did so without theorizing how those practices were
                constituted out of heterosexual and patriarchal relations.
                Antiracist social movements within Africa, Asia, the Caribbean,
                and North America not infrequently became sites where women,
                especially, were subject to gender and sexual oppression and
                regulation. As Cynthia Enloe (1989, 44) notes, “Nationalism
                typically has sprung from masculinized memory, masculinized
                humiliation and masculinized hope. Anger at being
                ‘emasculated’—or turned into a ‘nation of busboys’—has been
                presumed to be the natural fuel for igniting a nationalist
                movement.” In the US context, Angela Davis (1997) observes that
                the liberatory ideals of the civil rights and Black Power
                movements were constituted on unexamined heterosexual and
                patriarchal norms. As anticolonial and antiracist movements
                figured liberation and freedom either as the acquisition of
                rights that would eventually empower racially marginalized men
                or as the decolonization of colonized spaces for those men,
                these movements produced freedom and liberation as the extension
                of regimes of heterosexuality and patriarchy. As such, the
                antiracist critiques developed in these settings could only
                apprehend part of race’s genealogy as a social formation. Such
                analyses often failed to see how national liberation and
                rights-based action fostered new forms of power. Antiracist and
                anticolonial movements evinced a moral commitment to liberation
                and rights that did not necessarily entail a commitment to
                dismantling gender and sexual hierarchies.
              </p>
              <p className="article-paragraph">
                In contrast, women of color and third world feminist formations
                directly addressed freedom’s connection to gender and sexual
                regulation. In doing so, these formations provided what is
                referred to today as an intersectional model for a more complete
                consideration of the moral genealogy of racial projects. The
                Combahee River Collective (1983, 277), for instance, argued in
                its organizational statement, “We need to articulate the real
                class situation of persons who are not merely raceless, sexless
                workers, but for whom racial and sexual oppression are
                significant determinants in their working/economic lives.”
                Emerging from the failures and contradictions of national
                liberation and civil rights, this statement calls for a theory
                and practice of freedom that link differences of gender,
                sexuality, and class within specific epistemological and
                material formations. Subsequent work on the history of women of
                color and third world feminisms illustrates how the regulatory
                architecture of emancipatory projects resulted in postcolonial
                state formations that rearticulated the moral agendas of
                colonial regimes (M. Jacqui Alexander 1994). Hence postcolonial
                states represented the dawn of dubious forms of neocolonial
                freedom that depended on economic subordination to advanced
                capitalist states whose claims to universal freedoms were
                undermined by internal processes of exclusion at the level of
                gender and sexuality. Those processes, as M. Jacqui Alexander
                (1991) points out, eventuated in much regulatory activity,
                including the criminalization of lesbianism in the Caribbean.
              </p>
              <p className="article-paragraph">
                In the United States, the gendered and sexual legacies of civil
                rights have powerfully illustrated the ways in which
                rights-based projects extended (and continue to extend) regimes
                of gender and sexual normativity. We might understand the
                critical cultural and political practices of queers of color as
                inheriting women of color feminism’s critical assessment of
                liberation and emancipation. Groups such as Other Countries, Gay
                Men of African Descent, and the Audre Lorde Project have pointed
                to the historical and material limits of universal gay identity
                and the limited assumptions about freedom that such an identity
                presumes. The contemporary gay and lesbian movement has been
                organized along the axes of participation in the military,
                access to marriage and adoption, and protection from hate
                crimes, an agenda that has also been a means of fostering a
                universal gay identity (Spade and Willse 2000). In doing so,
                this mainstream movement has revealed itself as excluding the
                interests of queers marginalized by some intersectional
                combination of gender, race, and class. This analysis points to
                the ways in which hegemonic queer cultures presume the
                rationality of gay visibility, a visibility ritualized through
                the coming-out process and institutionalized through gay rights
                agendas. The study of race as it is applied to queer formations
                demonstrates how the mainstream gay rights movement fosters
                forms of white privilege and displaces queers of color,
                particularly those marginalized by class and nationality. We
                might therefore say that today’s racialized gay rights agendas
                emanate from the dialectic of freedom and unfreedom that arises
                out of an equally racialized genealogy of modern morality. Work
                by queer scholars who engage questions of racialized modernity
                intervenes into the study of race by observing how the array of
                nationalist and normative formations has expanded within the
                contexts of diaspora and contemporary globalization. Today, as
                it has for at least three centuries, the study of race names the
                different permutations of morality that continue to shape social
                formations according to freedom’s relationship to unfreedom.

              <p className="section-paragraph">
                Roderick A. Ferguson’s Race (2007) offers a critical analysis of
                race, arguing that it is not merely a biological category, but a
                social, political, and economic construct that has shaped
                history, identity, power, and morality. His essay examines how
                race has been central to the development of institutions,
                citizenship, labor, and cultural identity, while also critiquing
                the limitations of many anti-racist and anti-colonial movements.
                Ferguson highlights how gender and sexuality have often been
                excluded from these movements, calling for a more inclusive and
                intersectional approach to racial justice.

              </p>
              <p className="section-paragraph">
                Ferguson starts by explaining that race is not just about skin
                color but a system of power that influences knowledge, identity,
                and social structures. He discusses how racial differences have
                been used to define citizenship and labor, marking some bodies
                as deserving of rights while others face exclusion and violence.
                Race has played a crucial role in shaping how people see
                themselves and how societies function.

              <p className="section-paragraph">
                This analysis highlights the fluidity of race as a concept and
                how it is continually reshaped by political, economic, and
                cultural forces. Ferguson’s work urges us to view race as a tool
                for both liberation and oppression, depending on its use within
                specific contexts.

              <p className="section-paragraph">
                Ferguson traces the intellectual and political roots of
                contemporary race studies to the civil rights and national
                liberation movements of the 20th century. These movements not
                only fought for legal rights but also pushed for cultural
                recognition. They challenged traditional racial hierarchies and
                rejected the notion of race as a biological category,
                emphasizing that racial inequality is perpetuated by social and
                economic structures.

              </p>
              <p className="section-paragraph">
                Ferguson explains that racial identity became more than just a
                category of oppression—it became a source of political power and
                cultural pride. Movements like Black Power, Chicano activism,
                and Asian American activism used race as a tool for organizing
                and asserting agency. This shift influenced the creation of
                ethnic studies programs in the 1960s and 70s, challenging
                dominant racial narratives in academia.

                Ferguson critiques civil rights and national liberation
                movements for often neglecting issues of gender and sexual
                oppression. Feminist and queer scholars of color have pointed
                out that these movements, while challenging racism, still upheld
                patriarchal and heterosexual norms. For example, the Combahee
                River Collective emphasized that fighting racism alone wasn’t
                enough—gender and sexual oppression also had to be addressed.

                This intersectional perspective shows that gender and sexuality
                cannot be separated from discussions of race. Ferguson

                Ferguson connects race to the moral foundations of Western
                society, showing how modern ideas of freedom were built on
                racial exclusion. He references theorists like Jean-Jacques
                Rousseau, whose ideas about the transition from a "natural"
                state to a "civilized" state often excluded marginalized racial
                groups from being considered moral or fit for citizenship.

                This moral genealogy of race highlights the contradictions
                within modernity, where the promise of freedom often came with

                Ferguson critiques the field of sociology, which has often
                reinforced racial norms. While early sociologists like W.E.B. Du
                Bois sought to uplift Black communities, Ferguson points out
                that sociology often promoted patriarchal and heterosexual
                norms, reinforcing systems of oppression. For example,
                sociologists like Gunnar Myrdal argued that African Americans
                needed to conform to idealized family structures to gain
                citizenship, which also reinforced gendered and sexual
                subjugation.

              <p className="section-paragraph">
                Ferguson’s critique of sociology shows how racial liberation was

                Ferguson critiques nationalist and civil rights movements for
                not fully addressing gender and sexuality. Many movements framed
                liberation as a struggle for men's rights, while women and queer
                people remained marginalized. He cites feminist theorist Cynthia
                Enloe, who argues that nationalism often ignores women’s and
                queer people’s experiences in the struggle for liberation.

                post-colonial critiques, showing that even newly independent
                nations continued to enforce colonial-era gender and sexual
                norms, demonstrating how these struggles are interconnected.

                Ferguson’s essay challenges conventional views of race, arguing

              <li className="section-question">
                What is the central argument of Roderick A. Ferguson’s Race
                (2007), and how does it challenge traditional understandings of
                race?
                <p className="section-answer">
                  Ferguson’s central argument is that race is not a fixed
                  biological category but a dynamic social construct deeply
                  intertwined with power, freedom, and identity. He challenges
                  traditional understandings of race by emphasizing its role in
                  shaping political, economic, and cultural institutions.
                  Ferguson argues that race has been used to define citizenship,
                  labor, and corporeality, while also serving as a tool for
                  inclusion and exclusion within modern societies. By situating
                  race within the broader context of modernity, Ferguson reveals
                  how racialization is tied to moral, epistemological, and
                  material structures that perpetuate both freedom and
                  subjection.

              {/* Question 2 */}
              <li className="section-question">
                How does Ferguson connect the study of race to antiracist
                political struggles, particularly those of the 1950s and 1960s?
                <p className="section-answer">
                  Ferguson traces the intellectual and political roots of
                  contemporary race studies to antiracist movements, such as the
                  civil rights and national liberation struggles of the 1950s
                  and 1960s. These movements fundamentally reshaped how racial
                  minorities understood their identities and cultures,
                  displacing the notion of race as a biological inheritance and
                  reframing it as a category with political and economic
                  implications. Ferguson highlights how these movements
                  mobilized linguistic, historical, and artistic elements of
                  minority cultures to challenge racial oppression, leading to
                  the emergence of ethnic studies programs and the redefinition
                  of race as a form of cultural and political agency.

              <li className="section-question">
                What role do feminist and queer critiques play in Ferguson’s
                analysis of race?
                <p className="section-answer">
                  Feminist and queer critiques are central to Ferguson’s
                  analysis, as they complicate the understanding of race by
                  highlighting its intersections with gender, sexuality, and
                  class. Women of color and third world feminists, in
                  particular, have argued that antiracist movements often shared
                  unexamined affiliations with the very racist regimes they
                  opposed, particularly in their investment in heterosexual and
                  patriarchal forms of power. These critiques reveal how racial
                  ideologies are deeply embedded in gendered and sexualized
                  infrastructures, challenging the notion that race can be

                How does Ferguson situate race within the moral genealogy of
                Western modernity?
                <p className="section-answer">
                  Ferguson situates race within the moral genealogy of Western
                  modernity by examining how racialization is tied to the moral
                  and epistemological foundations of modern institutions. He
                  draws on theorists like David Theo Goldberg and Jean-Jacques
                  Rousseau to illustrate how race has been used to define
                  personal and social identity, often linking emancipation to
                  forms of subjection and regulation. Ferguson argues that
                  morality, in this context, serves as both a promise of freedom
                  and a mechanism for qualifying that freedom through gender and
                  sexual norms, revealing the paradoxical nature of racial
                  modernity.

                What is the significance of the Combahee River Collective’s
                statement in Ferguson’s analysis?
                <p className="section-answer">
                  The Combahee River Collective’s statement is significant in
                  Ferguson’s analysis because it articulates an intersectional
                  model for understanding race, gender, and class. The
                  Collective’s assertion that “racial and sexual oppression are
                  significant determinants in [people’s] working/economic lives”
                  underscores the interconnectedness of these systems of
                  oppression. Ferguson uses this statement to highlight the
                  limitations of earlier antiracist movements, which often
                  failed to address the ways in which gender and sexuality were
                  implicated in racial projects. The Collective’s work provides
                  a framework for a more comprehensive critique of
                  racialization.

                <p className="section-answer">
                  Ferguson critiques the gendered and sexual legacies of the
                  civil rights movement by arguing that rights-based projects
                  often extended regimes of gender and sexual normativity. He
                  points out that the liberatory ideals of the civil rights and
                  Black Power movements were often constituted on unexamined
                  heterosexual and patriarchal norms, which reproduced forms of
                  gender and sexual oppression. Ferguson highlights how these
                  movements, while challenging racial hierarchies, often failed
                  to address the ways in which their own practices reinforced
                  other forms of inequality.

                <p className="section-answer">
                  In Ferguson’s analysis, race and modernity are deeply
                  intertwined. He argues that racialization is a key feature of
                  Western modernity, shaping the moral, epistemological, and
                  material foundations of modern institutions. Ferguson draws on
                  theorists like Goldberg and Rousseau to illustrate how race
                  has been used to define personal and social identity, often
                  linking emancipation to forms of subjection and regulation. By
                  situating race within the broader context of modernity,
                  Ferguson reveals how racialization is tied to the production
                  of knowledge, the organization of political economy, and the
                  formation of racial subjects.

                <p className="section-answer">
                  Ferguson analyzes the role of morality in racial projects by
                  examining how moral frameworks have been used to regulate and
                  qualify freedom. He argues that both conservative and
                  liberatory demands for freedom have often relied on moral
                  frameworks that reinforce gender and sexual norms. Ferguson
                  highlights how morality, in the context of racial modernity,
                  serves as both a promise of freedom and a mechanism for
                  qualifying that freedom through regulation. This moral
                  genealogy, he argues, is crucial for understanding how race
                  operates as a social formation.

                What are the limitations of antiracist and anticolonial

                <p className="section-answer">
                  Ferguson argues that antiracist and anticolonial movements
                  often failed to address the ways in which their practices were
                  constituted out of heterosexual and patriarchal relations.
                  While these movements represented powerful challenges to
                  racial regimes, they frequently reproduced forms of gender and
                  sexual oppression. Ferguson highlights how the liberatory
                  ideals of these movements were often tied to the acquisition
                  of rights for racially marginalized men or the decolonization
                  of spaces for those men, thereby extending regimes of

                <p className="section-answer">
                  Ferguson’s analysis intersects with queer theory by examining
                  how racialized modernity shapes the experiences of queers of
                  color. He critiques the mainstream gay rights movement for
                  fostering a universal gay identity that excludes queers
                  marginalized by race, class, and nationality. Ferguson
                  highlights how the study of race as it applies to queer
                  formations reveals the ways in which hegemonic queer cultures
                  presume the rationality of gay visibility, often reinforcing

                <p className="section-answer">
                  Intersectionality is central to Ferguson’s work, as it
                  provides a framework for understanding how race, gender,
                  sexuality, and class intersect within specific epistemological
                  and material formations. Ferguson draws on the work of women
                  of color and third world feminists to highlight the
                  limitations of earlier antiracist movements, which often
                  failed to address the ways in which gender and sexuality were
                  implicated in racial projects. Intersectionality, in this

                <p className="section-answer">
                  Ferguson extends his analysis of race to the global context by
                  examining how racialized modernity shapes the experiences of
                  diaspora and contemporary globalization. He argues that the
                  study of race must account for the ways in which nationalist
                  and normative formations have expanded in these contexts,
                  continuing to shape social formations according to freedom’s
                  relationship to unfreedom. Ferguson highlights how
                  racialization operates not only at the local and national
                  levels but also within the global economy, where entire

                  Ferguson’s work contributes to the field of ethnic studies by

                  The broader implication of Ferguson’s argument is that race
