              The study of race incorporates a set of wide-ranging analyses of
              freedom and power. The scope of those analyses has much to do with
              the broad application of racial difference to academic and popular
              notions of epistemology, community, identity, and the body. With
              regard to economic and political formations, race has shaped the
              meaning and profile of citizenship and labor. In relation to
              corporeality, race has rendered the body into a text on which
              histories of racial differentiation, exclusion, and violence are
              inscribed. Analyzed in terms of subjectivity, race helps locate
              the ways in which identities are constituted.

              Many of these insights are the intellectual effects of antiracist
              political struggles, particularly ones organized around national
              liberation and civil rights. In the United States, the minority
              movements of the 1950s and 1960s fundamentally changed the ways in
              which racial minorities thought about their identities and
              cultures and the ways that race worked within US society (Omi and
              Winant [1986] 1994). In doing so, these movements intersected with
              sociological arguments that displaced notions of race as a strict
              biological inheritance and forced scholars to confront it as a
              category with broad political and economic implications. For the
              first time, there was mass mobilization around the deployment of
              the linguistic, historical, and artistic elements of minority
              cultures as a means of challenging racial oppression within the
              United States. Black, Chicano, and Asian American political and
              cultural groups emerged out of this context.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              In addition to cultural recovery, these groups argued for land
              redistribution, the end of police brutality, and community control
              over economic development. Race emerged out of these movements as
              an expression of cultural and political agency by marginalized
              groups. This was the notion of race that underwrote the ethnic
              studies movements of the 1960s and 1970s, including the student
              protests of 1968–69 that inaugurated the Division of Ethnic
              Studies at San Francisco State University. There and elsewhere,
              departments of Asian, Chicano, Native, and black studies worked to
              challenge race as a mode of exploitation within US society in
              particular and Western nations more generally (Marable 2000).

            <p className="text-lg">
              At the same time, insights about the various meanings of “race”
              have also arisen out of movements that countered these largely
              nation-based forms of racial politics. As postcolonial and
              poststructuralist theorists have illustrated, race is more than a
              way of identifying and organizing political coalitions against
              forms of state repression and capitalist exploitation; it is also
              a category that sets the terms of belonging and exclusion within
              modern institutions. David Theo Goldberg (1993, 87) captures this
              tension nicely: “[Race] has established who can be imported and
              who exported, who are immigrants and who are indigenous, who may
              be property and who are citizens; and among the latter who get to
              vote and who do not, who are protected by the law and who are its
              objects, who are employable and who are not, who have access and
              privilege and who are (to be) marginalized.” In other words, race
              both accounts for the logics by which institutions differentiate
              and classify, include and exclude, and names the processes by
              which people internalize those logics.

              Feminist and queer critiques of racial ideologies and discourses
              have complicated the matter further. As women of color and third
              world feminists have argued since the mid-to late 1970s, civil
              rights and national liberation struggles shared important and
              largely unappreciated affiliations with the very racist regimes to
              which they were responding, affiliations concerning mutual
              investments in heterosexual and patriarchal forms of power (C.
              Clarke 1983; Combahee River Collective 1983; A. Davis 1997;
              Ferguson 2004). One way of extending the interpretations by women
              of color and third world feminists of the gendered and sexualized
              infrastructure of racial discourse is to attend to the ways in
              which that infrastructure was produced within a genealogy of
              morality. Morality, in this context, has a much broader definition
              and application than its more restricted modern understanding,
              which sees it largely in terms of gender and sexual restrictions.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              In classical social theory, morality refers to the social powers
              and privileges that come with political and civil enfranchisement,
              thus referencing a horizon of possibility rather than an ambit of
              restrictions and limitations. It was precisely this quality of
              morality—its promise of enlargement and endowment—that made
              conservative and liberatory demands for freedom into vehicles for
              all types of regulations. Morality was both the promise of freedom
              and the qualification of that promise through regulation. When
              women of color and third world feminists troubled the gender and
              sexual footings of antiracist social movements, they were actually
              struggling against the moral inheritance of those movements—not
              simply the gender and sexual norms of those movements but also the
              imperative to stipulate freedom through regulation. Thinking about
              race within that genealogy allows us to see how a critical
              interrogation of race must address the gender and sexual
              itineraries of both conservative and liberatory politics. It
              permits us to further tease out the unexpected affiliations that
              revolutionary and nationalist definitions of race share with
              liberal-democratic and colonial deployments of race.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Several theorists have followed these leads by locating the
              procedures of racialization within the moral discourse of Western
              modernity. By doing so, they have interpreted modernity as an
              epistemological procedure that produces racial knowledge, a
              material formation that engenders the racial foundations of
              political economy, and a discursive formation that fosters racial
              subjects. Goldberg (1993, 14), for instance, situates our
              understanding of racial modernity within moral notions that
              constitute “personal and social identity.” Take as an example
              Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s linkage of race and morality in The Social
              Contract. According to Rousseau, man’s transition from the state
              of nature to civil society effects a moral change in “him,” one
              that delivers man to the morally constituted domain of civil
              society. In the state of nature, man is “governed by appetite
              alone”; in civil society, he is ruled by justice rather than
              instinct and through this subjection ascends to freedom and
              rationality. Man thus becomes a moral being who is part of a civil
              order that gives his “actions the moral quality they previously
              lacked” ([1762] 1968, 64–65). Rousseau’s formulation of morality
              as an entrance into freedoms that are both social and personal can
              help us see the ways in which morality expresses a racialized
              genealogy that links emancipation and subjection.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Through the history of racial formations, we can outline these
              connections between emancipation and subjection. Indeed, that
              history reveals how a commitment to political ideals of freedom
              and liberty was often understood in explicitly racial terms and
              how it required forms of gender and sexual governance. In the
              Caribbean plantation economy, for instance, slaveholders and
              colonizers stood as symbols not only of whiteness and freedom but
              also of gender and sexual morality. The bodies of nonwhite
              Caribbean subjects—blacks, “coloureds,” and indentured
              Indians—were unevenly constructed as outside the parameters of
              gender and sexual propriety (M. Jacqui Alexander 1994). In the
              nineteenth-century United States, black women’s bodies were
              similarly constructed as the antithesis of true womanhood, a
              womanhood presumably embodied by white femininity. Responding to
              this construction became a simultaneously moral and political
              agenda for black feminists during and beyond this period. As
              historian Darlene Clark Hine (1989) has argued, African American
              clubwomen subscribed in the late nineteenth century to Victorian
              ideologies of gender and sexual propriety as a means of subverting
              negative stereotypes about black women’s sexuality. In doing so,
              these clubwomen entered civil society by invoking forms of mastery
              and discipline, underlining and extending the connection between
              their relative freedom and the subjection of others.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              In the early twentieth century, this racialized genealogy shaped
              the emergence of sociology as a discipline that tried to
              assimilate US residents and citizens to the presumably rational
              ideals of liberal democracy. That discipline worked to reconcile
              communities of color, particularly African Americans, to the
              gender and sexual regimes of morality in part by pressuring them
              into normative US citizenship. For instance, W. E. B. Du Bois
              ([1900] 1978) argued for a partnership between the census (to
              track the social problems afflicting African American communities)
              and an emerging sociological profession (to lift African Americans
              from the moral residues of those problems). US sociology in the
              early to mid-twentieth century matured into a discipline that
              responded to the social changes of industrialization and migration
              by extending these moral prescriptions, including Gunnar Myrdal’s
              famous recommendation that African Americans adhere to the gender
              and sexual ideals of heterosexual patriarchy as a means of
              achieving citizenship—a recommendation that used the “instability
              of the Negro family” to argue that Negro culture is a “distorted
              development, or a pathological condition, of the general American
              culture” (1944, 928; see also Ferguson 2005). By advocating the
              rational ideals of liberal democracy, sociology linked the
              political to the social morality of citizenship. In other words, a
              commitment to the political ideals of citizenship entailed a
              fidelity to the nuclear family, conjugal marriage, and
              heterosexual monogamy. Given this genealogy, a critical
              interrogation of race needs to locate the links between
              citizenship and gender and sexual regulation. By studying race
              through its emergence within this genealogy, we obtain an
              understanding of political agency as the extension of power and
              discover how political freedom is tied to gender and sexual
              subjection.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Apprehending political agency through its connections to gender
              and sexual subjection is also a way of understanding the
              antiracist movements that decried regimes of race. Anticolonial
              and antiracist movements represented powerful challenges to racial
              regimes of colonial and liberal capitalist states. But they often
              did so without theorizing how those practices were constituted out
              of heterosexual and patriarchal relations. Antiracist social
              movements within Africa, Asia, the Caribbean, and North America
              not infrequently became sites where women, especially, were
              subject to gender and sexual oppression and regulation. As Cynthia
              Enloe (1989, 44) notes, “Nationalism typically has sprung from
              masculinized memory, masculinized humiliation and masculinized
              hope. Anger at being ‘emasculated’—or turned into a ‘nation of
              busboys’—has been presumed to be the natural fuel for igniting a
              nationalist movement.” In the US context, Angela Davis (1997)
              observes that the liberatory ideals of the civil rights and Black
              Power movements were constituted on unexamined heterosexual and
              patriarchal norms. As anticolonial and antiracist movements
              figured liberation and freedom either as the acquisition of rights
              that would eventually empower racially marginalized men or as the
              decolonization of colonized spaces for those men, these movements
              produced freedom and liberation as the extension of regimes of
              heterosexuality and patriarchy. As such, the antiracist critiques
              developed in these settings could only apprehend part of race’s
              genealogy as a social formation. Such analyses often failed to see
              how national liberation and rights-based action fostered new forms
              of power. Antiracist and anticolonial movements evinced a moral
              commitment to liberation and rights that did not necessarily
              entail a commitment to dismantling gender and sexual hierarchies.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              In contrast, women of color and third world feminist formations
              directly addressed freedom’s connection to gender and sexual
              regulation. In doing so, these formations provided what is
              referred to today as an intersectional model for a more complete
              consideration of the moral genealogy of racial projects. The
              Combahee River Collective (1983, 277), for instance, argued in its
              organizational statement, “We need to articulate the real class
              situation of persons who are not merely raceless, sexless workers,
              but for whom racial and sexual oppression are significant
              determinants in their working/economic lives.” Emerging from the
              failures and contradictions of national liberation and civil
              rights, this statement calls for a theory and practice of freedom
              that link differences of gender, sexuality, and class within
              specific epistemological and material formations. Subsequent work
              on the history of women of color and third world feminisms
              illustrates how the regulatory architecture of emancipatory
              projects resulted in postcolonial state formations that
              rearticulated the moral agendas of colonial regimes (M. Jacqui
              Alexander 1994). Hence postcolonial states represented the dawn of
              dubious forms of neocolonial freedom that depended on economic
              subordination to advanced capitalist states whose claims to
              universal freedoms were undermined by internal processes of
              exclusion at the level of gender and sexuality. Those processes,
              as M. Jacqui Alexander (1991) points out, eventuated in much
              regulatory activity, including the criminalization of lesbianism
              in the Caribbean.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              In the United States, the gendered and sexual legacies of civil
              rights have powerfully illustrated the ways in which rights-based
              projects extended (and continue to extend) regimes of gender and
              sexual normativity. We might understand the critical cultural and
              political practices of queers of color as inheriting women of
              color feminism’s critical assessment of liberation and
              emancipation. Groups such as Other Countries, Gay Men of African
              Descent, and the Audre Lorde Project have pointed to the
              historical and material limits of universal gay identity and the
              limited assumptions about freedom that such an identity presumes.
              The contemporary gay and lesbian movement has been organized along
              the axes of participation in the military, access to marriage and
              adoption, and protection from hate crimes, an agenda that has also
              been a means of fostering a universal gay identity (Spade and
              Willse 2000). In doing so, this mainstream movement has revealed
              itself as excluding the interests of queers marginalized by some
              intersectional combination of gender, race, and class. This
              analysis points to the ways in which hegemonic queer cultures
              presume the rationality of gay visibility, a visibility ritualized
              through the coming-out process and institutionalized through gay
              rights agendas. The study of race as it is applied to queer
              formations demonstrates how the mainstream gay rights movement
              fosters forms of white privilege and displaces queers of color,
              particularly those marginalized by class and nationality. We might
              therefore say that today’s racialized gay rights agendas emanate
              from the dialectic of freedom and unfreedom that arises out of an
              equally racialized genealogy of modern morality. Work by queer
              scholars who engage questions of racialized modernity intervenes
              into the study of race by observing how the array of nationalist
              and normative formations has expanded within the contexts of
              diaspora and contemporary globalization. Today, as it has for at
              least three centuries, the study of race names the different
              permutations of morality that continue to shape social formations
              according to freedom’s relationship to unfreedom.

              Roderick A. Ferguson’s *Race (2007)* fundamentally challenges the
              notion of race as a biological category, instead framing it as a
              dynamic social construct deeply embedded in systems of power,
              freedom, and identity. Ferguson argues that race has historically
              been used to shape notions of citizenship, labor, and
              corporeality, rendering the body a site of historical and
              political inscription. For example, he highlights how race has
              been instrumental in determining who is included or excluded from
              modern institutions, influencing who gets to be a citizen, who is
              employable, and who is marginalized.

              revealing how it is continually reshaped by political, economic,
              and cultural forces. Ferguson’s analysis invites readers to
              reconsider race not as a fixed category but as a tool for both
              liberation and oppression, depending on its deployment within
              specific historical and institutional contexts.

            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Ferguson traces the intellectual and political roots of
              contemporary race studies to the antiracist movements of the 1950s
              and 1960s, particularly the civil rights and national liberation
              struggles. These movements, he argues, fundamentally reshaped how
              racial minorities understood their identities and cultures,
              displacing the notion of race as a biological inheritance and
              reframing it as a category with political and economic
              implications. For instance, the mobilization of linguistic,
              historical, and artistic elements of minority cultures during this
              period served as a powerful tool for challenging racial
              oppression.

              San Francisco State University, which sought to challenge race as
              a mode of exploitation within US society. This redefinition of
              race as a form of cultural and political agency marked a
              significant shift in how race was understood and studied, paving
              the way for more nuanced analyses of racialization.

              in heterosexual and patriarchal forms of power. For example,
              Ferguson cites the Combahee River Collective’s statement, which

              Ferguson situates race within the moral genealogy of Western
              modernity, arguing that racialization is tied to the moral and
              epistemological foundations of modern institutions. He draws on
              theorists like David Theo Goldberg and Jean-Jacques Rousseau to
              illustrate how race has been used to define personal and social
              identity, often linking emancipation to forms of subjection and
              regulation. For instance, Rousseau’s *The Social Contract* posits
              that the transition from the state of nature to civil society
              involves a moral transformation, which Ferguson interprets as a
              racialized process.

                <p>
                  Ferguson’s central argument is that race is not a fixed
                  biological category but a dynamic social construct deeply
                  intertwined with power, freedom, and identity. He challenges
                  traditional understandings of race by emphasizing its role in
                  shaping political, economic, and cultural institutions.
                  Ferguson argues that race has been used to define citizenship,
                  labor, and corporeality, while also serving as a tool for
                  inclusion and exclusion within modern societies. By situating
                  race within the broader context of modernity, Ferguson reveals
                  how racialization is tied to moral, epistemological, and
                  material structures that perpetuate both freedom and
                  subjection.

                  civil rights and national liberation struggles of the 1950s
                  and 1960s. These movements fundamentally reshaped how racial
                  minorities understood their identities and cultures,

                  implications. Ferguson highlights how these movements
                  mobilized linguistic, historical, and artistic elements of
                  minority cultures to challenge racial oppression, leading to

                  movements, while challenging racial hierarchies, often failed
                  to address the ways in which their own practices reinforced
                  other forms of inequality.

                  What is the relationship between race and modernity in
                  Ferguson’s analysis?
                </strong>
                <p>
                  In Ferguson’s analysis, race and modernity are deeply
                  intertwined. He argues that racialization is a key feature of
                  Western modernity, shaping the moral, epistemological, and
                  material foundations of modern institutions. Ferguson draws on
                  theorists like Goldberg and Rousseau to illustrate how race
                  has been used to define personal and social identity, often
                  linking emancipation to forms of subjection and regulation. By
                  situating race within the broader context of modernity,
                  Ferguson reveals how racialization is tied to the production
                  of knowledge, the organization of political economy, and the
                  formation of racial subjects.

                <p>
                  Ferguson analyzes the role of morality in racial projects by
                  examining how moral frameworks have been used to regulate and
                  qualify freedom. He argues that both conservative and
                  liberatory demands for freedom have often relied on moral
                  frameworks that reinforce gender and sexual norms. Ferguson
                  highlights how morality, in the context of racial modernity,
                  serves as both a promise of freedom and a mechanism for
                  qualifying that freedom through regulation. This moral
                  genealogy, he argues, is crucial for understanding how race
                  operates as a social formation.

                <p>
                  Ferguson argues that antiracist and anticolonial movements
                  often failed to address the ways in which their practices were
                  constituted out of heterosexual and patriarchal relations.
                  While these movements represented powerful challenges to
                  racial regimes, they frequently reproduced forms of gender and
                  sexual oppression. Ferguson highlights how the liberatory
                  ideals of these movements were often tied to the acquisition
                  of rights for racially marginalized men or the decolonization
                  of spaces for those men, thereby extending regimes of
                  heterosexuality and patriarchy.

                <p>
                  Ferguson’s analysis intersects with queer theory by examining
                  how racialized modernity shapes the experiences of queers of
                  color. He critiques the mainstream gay rights movement for
                  fostering a universal gay identity that excludes queers
                  marginalized by race, class, and nationality. Ferguson
                  highlights how the study of race as it applies to queer
                  formations reveals the ways in which hegemonic queer cultures
                  presume the rationality of gay visibility, often reinforcing

                <p>
                  Intersectionality is central to Ferguson’s work, as it
                  provides a framework for understanding how race, gender,
                  sexuality, and class intersect within specific epistemological
                  and material formations. Ferguson draws on the work of women
                  of color and third world feminists to highlight the
                  limitations of earlier antiracist movements, which often
                  failed to address the ways in which gender and sexuality were
                  implicated in racial projects. Intersectionality, in this
                  context, allows for a more comprehensive critique of
                  racialization.

                  Ferguson extends his analysis of race to the global context by
                  examining how racialized modernity shapes the experiences of
                  diaspora and contemporary globalization. He argues that the
                  study of race must account for the ways in which nationalist
                  and normative formations have expanded in these contexts,
                  continuing to shape social formations according to freedom’s
                  relationship to unfreedom. Ferguson highlights how
                  racialization operates not only at the local and national
                  levels but also within the global economy, where entire
                  nations and regions are often labeled as “marginalized.”

                  Ferguson’s work contributes to the field of ethnic studies by

                  The broader implication of Ferguson’s argument is that race

                  is deeply tied to the moral, political, and economic
                  structures of modernity. He calls for a critical interrogation
                  of race that addresses its intersections with gender,
                  sexuality, and class, as well as its role in shaping both
