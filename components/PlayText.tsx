          <p className="text-lg">
            The play opens on a small farm in Southern California's Imperial
            Valley during the early 1930s. The Murata family—Murata, his wife
            Hana, and their daughter Masako—are preparing for the day. The stage
            is set with a simple farmhouse, a wooden bench, and a few scattered
            tools. The atmosphere is one of quiet resilience, as the family goes
            about their daily chores.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> (Coughing) Shack went up like a matchbox...
            This kind of weather dries everything... just takes a spark to make
            a bonfire out of dry timber.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Did you save any of it?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> No. Couldn't...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (To Masako) How many times have I told you...
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg">Masako moves nervously.</p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> No use crying about it now. Shikata ga nai.
            It's gone now. No more bathhouse. That's all there is to it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> But you've got to tell her. Otherwise she'll
            make the same mistake. You'll be building a bathhouse every year.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Murata removes his shirt and wipes off his face. He throws his shirt
            on a chair and sits at the table.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Bakal Ridiculous!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I didn't do it on purpose. (She goes to the
            bed, opens a book)
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Follows Masako) I know that but you know
            what this means? It means we bathe in a bucket... inside the house.
            Carry water in from the pond, heat it on the stove... We'll use more
            kerosene.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Tub's still there. And the fireplace. We
            can still build a fire under the tub.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Shocked) But no walls! Everyone in the
            country can see us!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Wait till dark then. Wait till dark.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> We'll be using a lantern. They'll still see
            us.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Angh! Who? Who'll see us? You think
            everyone in the country waits to watch us take a bath? Hunh! You
            know how stupid you sound? Ridiculous!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Defensively) It'll be inconvenient.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Hana is saved by a rap on the door. Oka, Issei neighbor, forty-five,
            enters. He is short and stout, dressed in faded work clothes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Hello! Hello! Oi! What's going on here? Hey!
            Was there some kind of fire?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Hana rushes to the door to let Oka in. He stamps the dust from his
            shoes and enters.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Oka-san! You just wouldn't believe... We had
            a terrible thing happen.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Yeah. Saw the smoke from down the road.
            Thought it was your house. Came rushing over. Is the fire out?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Murata half rises and sits back again. He's exhausted.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> (Gesturing) Oi, oi. Come in... sit down. No
            big problem. It was just our bathhouse.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Just the furoba, eh?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Just the bath.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Our Masako was careless and the furoba caught
            fire. There's nothing left of it but the tub.
          </p>

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> (Looking up from her book, pained) I didn't
            mean to...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Long as the tub's there, no problem. I'll help
            you with it. (He starts to roll up his sleeves. Murata looks at him)
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> What... now? Now?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Long as I'm here.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Oh, Papa. Aren't we lucky to have such
            friends?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> (To Hana) Hell, we can't work on it now.
            The ashes are still hot. I just now put the damned fire out. Let me
            rest awhile. (To Oka) Oi, how about a little sake? (Gesturing to
            Hana) Make sake for Oka-san.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Oka sits at the table. Hana goes to prepare the sake. She heats it,
            gets out the cups and pours it for the men.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> I'm tired... I am tired.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Oka-san has so generously offered his help...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Oka is uncomfortable. He looks around and sees Masako sitting on the
            bed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Hello, there, Masako-chan. You studying?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> No, it's summer vacation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> (Sucking in his breath) Kids nowadays... no
            manners...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> She's sulking because I had to scold her.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">Masako makes a small moan.</p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Drink Oka-san.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Swallowing) Ahhh, that's good.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Eh, you not working today?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> No... no... I took the afternoon off today. I
            was driving over to Nagatas' when I saw this big black cloud of
            smoke coming from your yard.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> It went up so fast...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> What's up at Nagatas'? (To Hana) Get the
            chiles out. Oka-san loves chiles.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Hana opens a jar of chiles and puts them on a plate. She serves the
            men and gets her mending basket and walks to Masako. Masako makes
            room for her on the bed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Helping himself) Ah, chiles. (Murata looks at
            him, the question unanswered) Well, I want to see him about my
            horse. I'm thinking of selling my horse.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Sell your horse!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Scratches his head) The fact is, I need some
            money. Nagata-san's the only one around made money this year, and
            I'm thinking he might want another horse.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Yeah, he made a little this year. And he's
            talking big... big! Says he's leasing twenty more acres this fall.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Twenty acres?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Yeah. He might want another horse.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Twenty acres, eh?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> That’s what he says. But you know his old
            woman makes all the decisions.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">Oka scratches his head.</p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> They’re doing all right.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Henh. Nagata-kun’s so hen-pecked, it’s
            pathetic. Peko-peko. (He makes motions of a hen pecking)
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Feeling the strain) I better get over there.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Why the hell you selling your horse?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> I need cash.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Oh, yeah. I could use some too. Seems like
            everyone’s getting out of the depression but the poor farmers.
            Nothing changes for us. We go on and on planting our tomatoes and
            summer squash and eating them... Well, at least it’s healthy.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Papa, do you have lumber?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Lumber? For what?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> The bath.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> (Impatiently) Don’t worry about that. We
            need more sake now.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">Hana rises to serve him.</p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> You sure Nagata-kun’s working twenty more
            acres?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Last I heard. What the hell; if you need a
            few bucks, I can loan you...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> A few hundred. I need a few hundred dollars.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Oh, a few hundred. But what the hell you
            going to do without a horse? Out here a man’s horse is as important
            as his wife.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Seriously) I don’t think Nagata will buy my
            wife.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            The men laugh, but Hana doesn’t find it so funny. Murata glances at
            her. She fills the cups again. Oka makes a half-hearted gesture to
            stop her. Masako watches the pantomime carefully. Oka swallows his
            drink in one gulp.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> I better get moving.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> What’s the big hurry?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Like to get the horse business done.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Ehhhh... relax. Do it tomorrow. He’s not
            going to die, is he?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Laughing) Hey, he’s a good horse. I want to
            get it settled today. If Nagata-kun won’t buy, I got to find someone
            else. You think maybe Kawaguchi...?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Not Kawaguchi... Maybe Yamamoto.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> What is all the money for, Oka-san? Does
            Emiko-san need an operation?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Nothing like that...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Sounds very mysterious.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> No mystery, Mrs. No mystery. No sale, no
            money, no story.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> (Laughing) That’s a good one. “No sale, no
            money, no...” Eh, Mama.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            He points to the empty cups. Hana fills the cups and goes back to
            Masako.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Muttering) I see we won’t be getting any
            work done today. (To Masako) Are you reading again? Maybe we’d still
            have a bath if you—
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I didn’t do it on purpose.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> (Loudly) I sure hope you know what you’re
            doing, Oka-kun. What’d you do without a horse?...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> I was hoping you’d lend me yours now and
            then... (He looks at Hana) I’ll pay for some of the feed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> (Emphatically waving his hand) Sure! Sure!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> The fact is, I need that money. I got a
            daughter in Japan and I just got to send for her this year.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Coming to life, Hana puts down her mending and sits at the table.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> A daughter? You have a daughter in Japan?
            Why, I didn’t know you had children. Emiko-san and you... I thought
            you were childless.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Scratching his head) We are. I was married
            before.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> You son-of-a-gun!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Is that so? How old is your daughter?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Kiyoko must be... fifteen now. Yeah, fifteen.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Fifteen! Oh, that would be too old for
            Emiko-san’s child. Is Kiyoko-san living with relatives in Japan?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Reluctantly) Yeah, with grandparents. With
            Shizue’s parents. Well, the fact is, Shizue, that’s my first wife,
            and Emiko were sisters. They come from a family with no sons. I was
            a boy when I went to work for the family... as an apprentice...
            they’re blacksmiths. Later I married Shizue and took on the family
            name—you know, yoshi—because they had no sons. My real name is
            Sakakihara.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Sakakihara! That’s a great name!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> A magnificent name!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> No one knows me by that here.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Should have kept that... Sakakihara.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Muttering) I don’t even know myself by that
            name.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> And Shizue-san passed away and you married
            Emiko-san?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Oh, yeah. Well, Shizue and I lived with the
            family for a while and we had the baby... that’s, you know,
            Kiyoko... (The liquor has affected him and he’s become less
            inhibited) Well, while I was serving apprentice with the family,
            they always looked down their noses at me. After I married, it got
            worse... That old man... angh! He was terrible! Always pushing me
            around, making me look bad in front of my wife and kid. That old man
            was mean... ugly!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Yeah, I heard about that apprentice
            work—detchi-boko... Heard it was damned humiliating.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> That’s the God’s truth!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Never had to do it myself. I came to
            America instead. They say detchi-boko is bloody hard work.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> The work’s all right. I’m not afraid of work.
            It’s the humiliation! I hated them! Pushing me around like I was
            still a boy... Me, a grown man! And married...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Continuing) ...and married to their daughter!
            They treated me like dirt. I hated them! But what could I do? I had
            a wife and kid to support. I couldn’t just walk away.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Yeah, I get it. It’s tough.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Nodding) Yeah, it’s tough. But I’m here now,
            and I’m doing what I can. I just need to get Kiyoko here. She’s all
            I’ve got left.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Sympathetically) It’s good you’re bringing
            her here. She’ll have a better life.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> I hope so. She’ll need friends. (He considers
            he might be making a mistake after all) What could I say to her?
            Stay there? It’s not what you think over here? I can’t help her? I
            just have to do this thing. I just have to do this one thing for
            her.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Sure...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Don’t worry. It’ll work out fine.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Murata gestures to Hana. She fills the cups.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> You talk about selling your horse, I
            thought you were pulling out.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> I wish I could. But there’s nothing else I can
            do.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Without money, yeah...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> You can go into some kind of business with
            money, but a man like me... no education... there’s no kind of job I
            can do. I’d starve in the city.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Dishwashing, maybe. Janitor...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> At least here we can eat. Carrots, maybe, but
            we can eat.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> All the carrots we been eating ’bout to
            turn me into a rabbit.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            They laugh. Hana starts to pour more wine for Oka but he stops her.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> I better not drink any more. Got to drive to
            Nagata-san’s yet. (He rises and walks over to Masako) You study
            hard, don’t you? You’ll teach Kiyoko English, eh? When she gets
            here...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Oh, yes. She will.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Kiyoko-san could probably teach her a thing
            or two.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> She won’t know about American ways...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I’ll help her.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Don’t worry, Oka-san. She’ll have a good
            friend in our Masako.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">They move toward the door.</p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Well, thanks for the sake. I guess I talk too
            much when I drink. (He scratches his head and laughs) Oh. I’m sorry
            about the fire. By the way, come to my house for your bath... until
            you build yours again.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Hesitantly) Oh, uh... thank you. I don’t
            know if...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Good! Good! Thanks a lot. I need a good hot
            bath tonight.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Tonight, then.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> We’ll be there.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Bowing) Thank you very much. Sayonara.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Nodding) See you tonight.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Oka leaves. Hana faces her husband as soon as the door closes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Papa, I don’t know about going over there.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> (Surprised) Why?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Well, Emiko-san...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> (Irritated) What’s the matter with you? We
            need a bath and Oka’s invited us over.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (To Masako) Help me clear the table.

            <strong>Act 1, Scene 2</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            That evening. We see the exterior wall of the Okas' weathered house.
            There is a workable screen door and a large screened window. Outside
            there is a wide wooden bench that can accommodate three or four
            people. There is one separate chair and a lantern stands against the
            house. The last rays of the sun light the area in a soft golden
            glow. This light grows gray as the scene progresses and it is quite
            dark at the end of the scene. Through the screened window, Emiko
            Oka, Issei woman, thirty, can be seen walking erratically back and
            forth. She wears a drab cotton dress but her grace and femininity
            come through. Her hair is in a bun, in the style of Issei women of
            the era.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Oka sits cross-legged on the bench. He wears a yukata [summer robe]
            and fans himself with a round Japanese fan.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            The Muratas enter. Murata carries towels and a bottle of sake. Hana
            carries the Victrola, and Masako a package containing their yukatas.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Standing to receive the Muratas) Oh, you’ve
            come. Welcome!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Yah... Good of you to ask us.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Bowing) Yes, thank you very much. (To
            Masako) Say “hello,” Masako.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> Hello.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> And “thank you.”
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> Thank you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Oka makes motion of protest. Emiko stops her pacing and watches from
            the window.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Glancing briefly at the window) And how is
            Emiko-san this evening?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Turning toward the house) Emil Emiko!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> That’s all right. Don’t call her out. She
            must be busy.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Half rising) Emiko!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Emiko comes to the door. Hana starts a deep bow toward the door.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> Konbanwa [Good evening!]
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Konbanwa, Emiko-san. I feel so bad about this
            intrusion. Your husband has told you, our bathhouse was destroyed by
            fire and he graciously invited us to come use yours.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">Emiko shakes her head.</p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> I didn’t have a chance to...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Recovering and nudging Masako) Say hello to
            Mrs. Oka.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> Hello, Mrs. Oka.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">Hana lowers the Victrola onto the bench.</p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> What’s this? You brought a phonograph?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> It’s a Victrola.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Laughing indulgently) Yes. Masako wanted to
            bring this over and play some records.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> (Extending the wine) Brought a little sake
            too.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Taking the bottle) Ah, now that I like.
            Emiko, bring out the cups.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            He waves at his wife, but she doesn’t move. He starts to ask again,
            but decides to get them himself. He enters the house and returns
            with two cups. Emiko seats herself on the single chair. The Muratas
            unload their paraphernalia; Oka pours the wine, the men drink, Hana
            chatters and sorts the records. Masako stands by, helping her.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (To Masako) Do you want to play a record now?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> (Nodding) Yes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Hana selects a record and places it on the Victrola. The music
            begins to play—a traditional Japanese folk song. Emiko, who has been
            sitting quietly, suddenly begins to sway to the music. Her movements
            are slow and deliberate, almost as if she is in a trance. The others
            watch her, unsure of how to react.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Embarrassed) Emiko, what are you doing?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Emiko does not respond. She continues to dance, her eyes closed,
            lost in the music. The Muratas exchange uneasy glances.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Trying to lighten the mood) Oh, she’s just
            enjoying the music. Isn’t that right, Emiko-san?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Emiko still does not respond. She begins to hum along with the
            music, her voice soft and haunting. The atmosphere grows tense.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> (To Oka) Maybe we should turn it off.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Nodding) Yeah, maybe.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Hana stops the record. The music fades, and Emiko slowly stops
            dancing. She opens her eyes and looks around, as if waking from a
            dream. The others are silent, unsure of what to say.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> (Softly) That song... it reminds me of home.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Politely) Oh, yes. It’s a beautiful song.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> (Still lost in thought) I used to dance to
            this song... back in Japan.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Awkwardly) Well, that’s enough of that. Let’s
            have some more sake.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            He pours more sake for the men. Emiko remains seated, her gaze
            distant. The tension in the air is palpable.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Trying to break the tension) Emiko-san,
            would you like to join us for a drink?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> (Shaking her head) No, thank you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Persisting) Are you sure? It’s very good
            sake.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> (Still distant) No, I’m fine.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (To Hana) Don’t mind her. She’s always like
            this.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (Sympathetically) It must be hard for her...
            being so far from home.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> (Shrugging) She’ll get used to it. We all do.

          <p className="text-lg">
            The conversation lags. The Muratas finish their drinks and prepare
            to leave. Emiko remains seated, her gaze fixed on some distant
            point. As they leave, Hana glances back at Emiko, a look of concern
            on her face.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> (To Murata) She’s so sad... I wish there was
            something we could do.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Murata:</strong> (Shaking his head) There’s nothing we can
            do. She has to find her own way.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            They exit, leaving Emiko alone on the bench. She sits quietly for a
            moment, then begins to hum the song again, softly, to herself. The
            light fades as the scene ends.

            Same evening. Lights cross-fade to the exterior of the Oka house.
            The Muratas have just left. Emiko sits on the bench. Her back is to
            Oka. Oka, still standing, looks at her contemptuously as she takes
            the bottle and one of the cups to pour herself a drink.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Nothing more disgusting than a drunk woman.
            (Emiko ignores him) You made a fool of yourself. Washi baka ni

            place. You think you’re too good for this life. You think you’re too

            Muratas’ kitchen, afternoon. The calendar reads September. Masako is
            at the kitchen table with several books. She thumbs through a
            Japanese magazine. Hana is with her, sewing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> Do they always wear kimonos in Japan, Mama?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Most of the time.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I wonder if Kiyoko will be wearing a kimono
            like this?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> She might. But she’s been in America for a
            while now. She might wear American clothes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I hope she wears a kimono. I’ve never seen
            one up close.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> You’ll see one soon enough. Kiyoko will be
            here any day now.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> Do you think she’ll like me?

          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I don’t know. I’m not very good at making
            friends.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> You’ll be fine. Just be yourself.

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I hope she likes books. I don’t know what

          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> You’ll find something to talk about. Don’t

          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I just want her to like me.

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> She will. Now, why don’t you help me with
            this sewing? You’ll need to know how to sew when you’re older.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I don’t want to sew. I want to read.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> You can’t read all the time. You need to
            learn practical things too.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I know how to sew. You’ve taught me
            already.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Then practice. You can never be too good at
            sewing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I don’t want to. I want to read.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Masako, you’re being difficult. Just help me
            for a little while.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> Fine.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Masako reluctantly picks up a piece of fabric and begins to sew.
            Hana watches her for a moment, then returns to her own sewing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> You’ll thank me one day.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I doubt it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Hana sighs and continues sewing. The sound of a car engine is heard
            in the distance.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> Do you hear that?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Hear what?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> A car. It’s coming this way.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> It’s probably just someone passing by.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> No, it’s slowing down. I think it’s
            stopping.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Well, let’s see who it is.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Hana and Masako go to the window and look out. A car pulls up in
            front of the house. Oka and Kiyoko get out of the car. Kiyoko is
            dressed in a conservative cotton dress and looks nervous.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> It’s them! It’s Kiyoko!

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Yes, it is. Let’s go greet them.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Hana and Masako go outside to greet Oka and Kiyoko.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Welcome, Kiyoko-san. We’ve been expecting
            you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Kiyoko:</strong> Thank you. It’s nice to be here.

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> I hope we’re not interrupting anything.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Not at all. We were just sewing. Come in,
            come in.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            They all go inside. Kiyoko looks around nervously.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> Do you like books, Kiyoko-san?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Kiyoko:</strong> Yes, I do.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> Good. I have a lot of books. We can read
            together.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Kiyoko:</strong> That would be nice.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Why don’t you show Kiyoko-san to her room,
            Masako? She must be tired from the trip.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> Okay. Follow me, Kiyoko-san.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Masako leads Kiyoko to her room. Hana and Oka sit down at the table.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> How was the trip?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> It was fine. Kiyoko was quiet most of the way.
            I think she’s nervous.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> That’s understandable. It’s a big change for
            her.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Yes, it is. I hope she’ll be happy here.

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> She will be. Masako will make sure of that.

            <strong>Kiyoko:</strong> I’d like that.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Dinner’s ready. Let’s eat.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            They all sit down to eat. The tension eases as they enjoy the meal.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> This is delicious, Hana. Thank you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> You’re welcome. I’m glad you like it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Kiyoko:</strong> It’s very good. Thank you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> You’re welcome, Kiyoko-san. I hope you’ll
            feel at home here.

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Kiyoko:</strong> I think I will.

          <p className="text-lg">
            They continue eating in comfortable silence.

            A few days later. The Muratas’ kitchen. Hana is sewing, and Masako
            is reading. Kiyoko enters, looking distressed.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Kiyoko-san, what’s wrong?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Kiyoko:</strong> It’s... it’s Emiko-san. She’s been drinking
            again.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Oh, no. Is she all right?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Kiyoko:</strong> I don’t know. She’s been crying and saying
            strange things.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> We should go check on her.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I’ll come too.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> No, you stay here. This is something for

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> But I want to help.

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> I know you do, but it’s better if you stay
            here. We’ll be back soon.

          <p className="text-lg">
            Hana and Kiyoko leave. Masako sits down, looking worried.

            <strong>Hana:</strong> She’s... not well. She’s very upset.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Kiyoko:</strong> She keeps talking about Japan and how she
            wants to go back.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> It’s hard for her. She misses her old life.

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> Can’t we do something to help her?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> We can try, but it’s not easy. She has to
            want to help herself.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Kiyoko:</strong> I feel so helpless.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> Maybe if we spend more time with her,

          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> That’s a good idea. We’ll try to include her
            more.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Kiyoko:</strong> Thank you. I just want her to be happy.

            A few days later. The exterior of the Oka house. Emiko is sitting on
            the bench, drinking. Oka approaches her, looking angry.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> You’ve been drinking too much lately. It’s not

          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> What do you care? You don’t care about me.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> That’s not true. I do care about you. But
            you’re destroying yourself.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Maybe I want to destroy myself. Maybe I
            don’t care anymore.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Don’t talk like that. You have a lot to live

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Make the best of it? How? By pretending

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> It’s not easy for any of us, but we have to

          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> I’m tired of trying. I’m tired of

            <strong>Emiko:</strong> It’s too late for that. I’ve already given
            up.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> No, you haven’t. You’re stronger than this.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> You don’t know me. You don’t know what I’ve
            been through.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> I know it’s been hard, but we can get through

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Together? We’re not together. We’re just two
            people living in the same place, miserable and alone.

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> That’s not true. We have each other.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Do we? Do we really have each other?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Yes, we do. And we have Kiyoko. She needs us.

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Kiyoko... she’s better off without me.

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> That’s not true. She needs you. She needs both
            of us.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> I can’t be what she needs. I can’t even be
            what I need.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Emiko, please. Don’t give up on us. Don’t give
            up on yourself.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> It’s too late, Oka. It’s too late.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Emiko takes another drink. Oka looks at her, helpless and
            frustrated. He turns and walks away, leaving Emiko alone on the
            bench. She continues to drink, lost in her own thoughts.

            Same day, late afternoon. Exterior of the Murata house. The light is
            soft. Hana is sweeping the yard; Masako hangs a glass wind chime on
            the exposed wall.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> There... there. That’s a good place.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> Here?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> It must catch the slightest breeze. (Sighing
            and listening) It brings back so much... That’s the reason I never
            hung one before. I guess it doesn’t matter much anymore...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I thought you liked to think about Japan.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> I didn’t want to hear that sound so often...
            get too used to it. Sometimes you hear something too often, after a
            while you don’t hear it anymore... I didn’t want that to happen. The
            same thing happens to feelings too, I guess. After a while you don’t
            feel anymore. You’re too young to understand that yet.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I understand, Mama.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Wasn’t it nice of Kiyoko-san to give us the
            furin?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> I love it. I don’t know anything about
            Japan, but it makes me feel something too.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Maybe someday when you’re grown up, gone
            away, you’ll hear it and remember yourself as this little girl...
            remember this old house, the ranch, and... your old mama...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> That’s kind of scary.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Emiko enters unsteadily. She carries a bundle wrapped in a furoshiki
            (colorful scarf). In the package are two beautiful kimonos.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Emiko-san! What a pleasant surprise! Please
            sit down. We were just hanging the furin. It was so sweet of
            Kiyoko-san to give it to Masako. She loves it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Emiko looks mildly interested. She acts as normal as she can
            throughout the scene, but at times drops her facade, revealing her
            desperation.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Thank you. (She sets her bundle on the bench
            but keeps her hand on it)
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Your family was here earlier. (Emiko smiles
            vaguely) On their way to the pictures, I think. (To Masako) Make tea
            for us, Ma-chan.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Please don’t...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Kiyoko-san was looking so nice—her hair all
            curly... Of course, in our day, straight black hair was desirable.
            Of course, times change.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Yes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> But she did look fine. My, my, a colorful new
            dress, new shoes, a permanent wave—looked like a regular American
            girl. Did you choose her dress?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> No... I didn’t go.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> You know, I didn’t think so. Very pretty
            though. I liked it very much. Of course, I sew all Masako’s clothes.
            It saves money. It’ll be nice for you to make things for Kiyoko-san
            too. She’d be so pleased. I know she’d be pleased...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            While Hana talks, Emiko plucks nervously at her package. She waits
            for Hana to stop talking.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Emiko-san, is everything all right?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Yes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Masako, please go make tea for us. See if
            there aren’t any more of those crackers left. Or did you finish
            them? (To Emiko) We can’t keep anything in this house. She eats
            everything as soon as Papa brings it home. You’d never know it,
            she’s so skinny. We never have anything left for company.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Masako:</strong> We hardly ever have company anyway.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Hana gives her daughter a strong look, and Masako goes into the
            house. Emiko is lost in her own thoughts. She strokes her package.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Is there something you... I can help you
            with? (Very gently) Emiko-san?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Oh no. I was thinking... Now that... now
            that... Masako is growing up... older...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Oh, yes. She’s growing fast.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> I was thinking... (She stops, puts the
            package on her lap and is lost again)
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Yes, she is growing. Time goes so fast. I
            think she’ll be taller than me soon. (She laughs weakly, stops and
            looks puzzled)
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Yes.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Emiko’s depression pervades the atmosphere. Hana is affected by it.
            The two women sit in silence for a moment.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Emiko-san, is there something you want to
            tell me?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> No... nothing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> You know you can talk to me, don’t you?

          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Yes... I know.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Then what is it? What’s troubling you?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> It’s nothing... really.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Emiko-san, please. You can’t keep everything
            inside. It’s not good for you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> I know... but there’s nothing to say.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> Sometimes just talking helps.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Maybe... but not now.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Hana:</strong> All right. But remember, I’m here if you need
            me.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Thank you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Emiko stands up, clutching her package. She looks at Hana for a
            moment, then turns and walks away. Hana watches her go, concerned.

            <strong>Act 2, Scene 6</strong>
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Evening. The exterior of the Oka house. Emiko sits on the bench,
            holding the empty can that once held her savings. Oka approaches
            her, looking tired and defeated.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Emiko, what are you doing out here?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Thinking.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> About what?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> About everything. About nothing.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> You’ve been drinking again, haven’t you?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> What if I have?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> It’s not good for you. You know that.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> What does it matter? Nothing matters
            anymore.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> That’s not true. You matter. Kiyoko matters.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> Kiyoko... she’s better off without me.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> That’s not true. She needs you. She needs both
            of us.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> I can’t be what she needs. I can’t even be
            what I need.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Emiko, please. Don’t give up on us. Don’t give
            up on yourself.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> It’s too late, Oka. It’s too late.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Emiko takes another drink. Oka looks at her, helpless and
            frustrated. He turns and walks away, leaving Emiko alone on the
            bench. She continues to drink, lost in her own thoughts.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> What did you do with it?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> I don’t have it.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> It’s gone! It’s gone?
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> Yeah! It’s gone. I spent it. The hell! Every
            last cent.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> The new clothes... the curls...
            restaurants... pictures... shoes... My money... my going-home
            money...
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> You through!
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Emiko:</strong> What will I do? What will—
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            <strong>Oka:</strong> I don’t care what you do. Walk. Use your feet.
            Swim to Japan. I don’t care. I give you no more than you gave me.
            Now I don’t want anything. I don’t care what you do. (He walks away)
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg">
            Emiko still holds the empty can. Offstage we hear Oka’s car door
            slam and the sound of his old car starting off. Accustomed to crying
            alone, she doesn’t utter a sound. Her shoulders begin to shake, her
            dry soundless sobs turn to a silent laugh. She wipes the dust gently
            from the can as though comforting a friend. Her movements become
            sensuous, her hands move on to her own body, around her throat, over
            her breasts, to her hips, caressing, soothing, reminding her of her
            lover’s hands. Fade-out.
